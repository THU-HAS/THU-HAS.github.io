Traditional scale-out over TCP/IP or RDMA incurs high overhead from network latency and data movement. Emerging Compute Express Link (CXL) enables near-local-latency shared memory across hosts, offering a promising path for scaling IMKVS. However, existing CXL-based systems prioritize performance and overlook security, leaving shared memory exposed to unauthorized access. In this work, we present SHMemora, to the best of our knowledge, the first protective multi-host IMKVS built on CXL-based shared memory in coherent Distributed Shared Memory (DSM) environments. SHMemora addresses three key challenges, including strict protection enforcement, fine-grained memory protection, and scalable metadata management. These are solved by SHMemora through Intel MPK-based memory isolation, a capability-based protection, and metadata batching, respectively. We implement SHMemora on real CXL hardware and evaluate its security through formal proofs and penetration tests, and its performance through microbenchmarks and real workloads, demonstrating both strong protection guarantees and practical scalability. SHMemora achieves an average of 3.45× throughput compared to Redis under multiple hosts, incurring an average of 1.68% throughput overhead for the security protection.","tags":[],"title":"SHMemora: Protective Key-Value Store on Distributed Shared Memory","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yuchen Fan","Yu Jin","Chang Liu","Minghong Sun","Xuanzeng Song","Tingting Yin","Shuwen Deng"],"categories":null,"content":"\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\n","date":1770076800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1770076800,"objectID":"2eb4f9d01319b5eb2c368dcb30e1194d","permalink":"https://thu-has.github.io/publication/2026-drow/","publishdate":"2025-12-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2026-drow/","section":"publication","summary":"\"\"\n","tags":[],"title":"DROW: Training-Free Load Speculative Execution Attacks on Apple Silicon","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ben Chen","Kunlin Li","Shuwen Deng","Dongsheng Wang","Yun Chen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1770076800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1770076800,"objectID":"01d463f32ef6beeb1d4856f99c756271","permalink":"https://thu-has.github.io/publication/2026-dsassassin/","publishdate":"2025-12-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2026-dsassassin/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"DSASSASSIN: Cross-VM Side-Channel Attacks by Exploiting Intel Data Streaming Accelerator","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tengjiao Fu","Yu Jin","Dongsheng Wang","Shuwen Deng","Yun Chen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1766188800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1766188800,"objectID":"ec9a24f9dd99baefd9f4a217791d4db3","permalink":"https://thu-has.github.io/publication/2025-ppa/","publishdate":"2025-01-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2025-ppa/","section":"publication","summary":"Hardware data prefetchers are designed to fetch memory in advance to reduce cache misses and mitigate memory bottlenecks.

Major commercial CPU vendors, e.g., Intel, Arm, and AMD, incorporate various prefetchers in their products to optimize memory latency. While these prefetchers can significantly enhance performance, they can also introduce security concerns by accessing unintended data. In this paper, we reveal new features of prefetchers in recent Intel Xeon processors, termed the page prefetcher. We find that this page prefetcher is indexed by the instruction pointer (IP) and can prefetch page translations (into the TLB) and cache lines across page boundaries. To investigate its implications, we propose several attacks using our page prefetcher attack (PPA) primitives. We demonstrate that PPA can be leveraged to expose kernel information to user space, and secrets from SGX enclaves to untrusted zones, such as control flow details. Furthermore, when combined with transient attacks, PPA can extend information leakage.

We also identify undisclosed features, such as the next-three-line prefetching mechanism and direct forwarding of evicted instructions from data cache to instruction cache. Furthermore, we develop four types of covert channels, achieving up to 1.68 MB/s with a 0.01% error rate. For side-channel attacks, GhostCache enables three types of timer-free real-world attacks. The first is an end-to-end website fingerprinting attack, achieving 92.02% accuracy across 100 website classes. The second is a set of kernel leakage attacks, including the discovery of a new Spectre disclosure gadget via a function pointer to leak arbitrary kernel data at 92.91% accuracy.

Micro-operation (micro-op) cache is a key unit to help improve the energy efficiency of the CPU frontend. Unfortunately, we find that data center applications suffer from frequent micro-op cache misses due to the lack of an effective micro-op cache replacement policy. Developing micro-op cache-specific replacement policies is challenging, as there currently does not exist an optimal theoretical solution akin to Belady’s algorithm for conventional caches. As a result, it is unknown by how much replacement policies can be improved and how to get there. To address these challenges, we introduce FLACK, a new near-optimal offline policy that considers the key features of the micro-op cache, such as variable and disproportional costs of micro-op cache misses and partial hits. We show that FLACK substantially outperforms Belady’s algorithm, thus establishing a new baseline for micro-op cache replacement policies. We then design FURBYS, a practical policy that mimics FLACK via profile-guided methods. FURBYS has three key components to perform cache replacement decisions: (1) it uses profiles of the whole-execution hit/miss behavior, (2) it detects locally (transiently) hot data, and (3) it selectively ignores data with profiled low hit rates. We evaluate FLACK and FURBYS using 11 data center applications and find that FLACK demonstrates an average bound of 30.21% miss reduction, achieving 4.46% greater miss reduction than Belady’s algorithm. Our practical policy, FURBYS, provides 14.34% average miss reduction compared to LRU, which is 1.84× greater than the current state-of-the-art replacement policy, contributing to 3.10% of performance-per- watt improvement for the CPU core. On average, in terms of miss reduction and IPC gain, FURBYS is equivalent to LRU policy on 1.5× micro-op cache sizes (up to 2×), demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed replacement policy.","tags":[],"title":"From Optimal to Practical: Efficient Micro-op Cache Replacement Policies for Data Center Applications","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Haojie Ye","Yuchen Xia","Yuhan Chen","Kuan-Yu Chen","Yichao Yuan","Shuwen Deng","Baris Kasikci","Trevor Mudge","Nishil Talati"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1740960000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1740960000,"objectID":"c6f39f7c40aa959e149be2d497df60c8","permalink":"https://thu-has.github.io/publication/co-public/2025-palermo/","publishdate":"2025-02-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/co-public/2025-palermo/","section":"publication","summary":"Oblivious RAM (ORAM) hides the memory access patterns, enhancing data privacy by preventing attackers from discovering sensitive information based on the sequence of mem- ory accesses. The performance of ORAM is often limited by its inherent trade-off between security and efficiency, as concealing memory access patterns imposes significant computational and memory overhead. While prior works focus on improving the ORAM performance by prefetching and eliminating ORAM requests, we find that their performance is very sensitive to workload locality behavior and incurs additional management overhead caused by the ORAM stash pressure. This paper presents Palermo: a protocol-hardware co-design to improve ORAM performance. The key observation in Palermo is that classical ORAM protocols enforce restrictive dependen- cies between memory operations that result in low memory bandwidth utilization. Palermo introduces a new protocol that overlaps large portions of memory operations, within a single and between multiple ORAM requests, without breaking correctness and security guarantees. Subsequently, we propose an ORAM controller architecture that executes the proposed protocol to service ORAM requests. The hardware is responsible for concur- rently issuing memory requests as well as imposing the necessary dependencies to ensure a consistent view of the ORAM tree across requests. Using a rich workload mix, we demonstrate that Palermo outperforms the RingORAM baseline by 2.9×, on average, incurring a negligible area overhead of 5.78mm2 (less than 2% in 12th generation Intel CPU after technology scaling) and 2.14W without sacrificing security.

This is because most mitigations hurt modern processors’ speculative nature, which is essential to many optimization techniques. To address this, numerous scanners have been developed to identify vulnerable code snippets (speculative gadgets) within software applications, allowing mitigations to be applied selectively and thereby minimizing performance degradation. In this paper, we show that existing speculative gadget scanners lack accuracy, often misclassifying gadgets due to limited modeling of timing properties. Instead, we identify another fundamental condition intrinsic to all speculative attacks—the timing requirement as a race condition inside the gadget. Specifically, the attacker must optimize the race condition between speculated authorization and secret leakage to successfully exploit the gadget. Therefore, we introduce GadgetMeter, a framework designed to quantitatively gauge the exploitability of speculative gadgets based on their timing property. We systematically explore the attacker’s power to optimize the race condition inside gadgets (windowing power). A Directed Acyclic Instruction Graph is used to model timing conditions and static analysis and runtime testing are combined to optimize attack patterns and quantify gadget vulnerability. We use GadgetMeter to evaluate gadgets in a wide range of software, including six real-world applications and the Linux kernel. Our result shows that GadgetMeter can accurately identify exploitable speculative gadgets and quantify their vulnerability level, identifying 471 gadgets reported by GadgetMeter works as unexploitable.","tags":[],"title":"GadgetMeter: Quantitatively and Accurately Gauging the Exploitability of Speculative Gadgets","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jianfeng Wang","Huazhong Yang","Shuwen Deng","Xueqing Li"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1733097600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1733097600,"objectID":"610c6385e964001c95bbd93355bb7a4e","permalink":"https://thu-has.github.io/publication/2024-cimsat/","publishdate":"2025-06-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2024-cimsat/","section":"publication","summary":"Compute-in-memory (CiM) architecture is an emerging energyefficient processing paradigm that has attracted widespread attention in AI and Internet of Things (IoT) applications.

However, most existing chiplet-related works focus on DNN inference. Directly porting them to LLM training introduces significantly large quantities of DRAM access and network-on-package (NoP) overheads which make state-of-the-art chiplet designs fail, highlighting a research gap. This work proposes Hecaton, a scalable and cost-effective chiplet system for LLM training. We first provide a chiplet architecture with tailored scheduling that can largely reduce DRAM accesses. We further design an efficient distributed training method that reduces NoP communication complexity and relieves constraints on SRAM capacity and layout. Theoretical analysis shows that the entire system achieves weak scaling: as the workload and hardware resources grow proportionally, the computation-to-communication ratio remains nearly constant. Experiments with various workloads and hardware configurations verify the property, and Hecaton achieves 5.29× performance improvement and 3.46× energy reduction on Llama3.1-405B, compared to the tensor parallelism in Megatron.

Typically, keys are stored in tamper-proof memory and are subsequently delivered to logic locking modules through scan chains. However, recent physical attacks have successfully extracted keys directly from registers, challenging the security of the prior scan obfuscation/blocking efforts. This paper mitigates the threat of direct value extraction by proposing TroScan, an architecture that leverages the internal frequency of register chains to activate trigger circuits. We propose three key generation methods for typical defense scenarios and gate-aware obfuscation optimization.

Today, the dominant method to erase the qubit state is a full system wipe, which effectively resets all the qubits at the same time. In today's superconducting qubit machines from IBM, for example, a full system wipe takes up to 1000 μs, and it fully erases all information in the system. However, with a full system wipe there is no means for only a few qubits to be cleared and assigned to a new user or program; everything has to be erased at the same time. A secure reset operation could allow resetting only a subset of qubits, and it could be built upon existing (insecure) reset operation available from superconducting qubit machines from IBM, for example. The (insecure) reset operation is available today, which can be used to reset the state of a qubit in a time on the order of 10 μs down to 1 μs. The reset operation is thus much faster than a full system wipe. However, as this work demonstrates, it is possible to leak some information across the (insecure) reset operation as it does not perfectly reset the qubit state between two users or programs who may be sequentially scheduled on the same qubit. Further, crosstalk-like effects are observed where reset behavior of one qubit can be inferred from an adjacent qubit. This work analyzes the existing (insecure) reset operation in order to understand how a secure reset operation could be built upon it. This work then describes the design, implementation, and evaluation of the proposed secure reset operation which can reset qubits without leaking information, and retains a factor of 300 speedup over a full system~wipe.","tags":[],"title":"Securing Reset Operations in NISQ Quantum Computers","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1666569600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666569600,"objectID":"1c971112dbbe30360a6a438f51a643e7","permalink":"https://thu-has.github.io/join-us/","publishdate":"2022-10-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/join-us/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Contact","type":"landing"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1666569600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666569600,"objectID":"c1d17ff2b20dca0ad6653a3161942b64","permalink":"https://thu-has.github.io/people/","publishdate":"2022-10-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/people/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"People","type":"landing"},{"authors":["Shuwen Deng","Wenjie Xiong","Jakub Szefer"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1664150400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1664150400,"objectID":"e303f2f3aaaea039dc61c7ed15990798","permalink":"https://thu-has.github.io/publication/2022-leaky-frontends/","publishdate":"2024-10-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2022-leaky-frontends/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper evaluates new security threats due to the processor frontend in modern Intel processors. The root causes of the security threats are the multiple paths in the processor frontend that the micro-operations can take: through the MicroInstruction Translation Engine (MITE), through the Decode Stream Buffer (DSB), also called the Micro-operation Cache, or through the Loop Stream Detector (LSD). Each path has its own unique timing and power signatures, which lead to the sideand covert-channel attacks presented in this work. Especially, the switching between the different paths leads to observable timing or power differences which, as this work demonstrates, could be exploited by attackers. Because of the different paths, the switching, and way the components are shared in the frontend between hardware threads, two separate threads are able to be mutually influenced and timing or power can reveal activity on the other thread. The security threats are not limited to multi-threading, and this work further demonstrates new ways for leaking execution information about SGX enclaves or a new in-domain Spectre variant in single-thread setting. Finally, this work demonstrates a new method for fingerprinting the microcode patches of the processor by analyzing the behavior of different paths in the frontend.

The vulnerabilities can lead to user information and data being compromised or stolen. In particular, the ending of both Moore's law and Dennard scaling motivate the design of more exotic microarchitectural optimizations to extract more performance -- further exacerbating the security vulnerabilities. The performance optimizations often focus on sharing or re-using of hardware components within a processor, between different users or programs. Because of the sharing of the hardware, unintentional information leakage channels, through the shared components, can be created. Microarchitectural attacks, such as the high-profile Spectre and Meltdown attacks or the cache covert channels that they leverage, have demonstrated major vulnerabilities of modern computer architectures due to the microarchitectural optimizations. Key components of processor microarchitectures are processor caches used for achieving high memory bandwidth and low latency for frequently accessed data. With frequently accessed data being brought and stored in caches, memory latency can be significantly reduced when data is fetched from the cache, as opposed to being fetched from the main memory. With limited processor chip area, however, the cache size cannot be very large. Thus, modern processors adopt a cache hierarchy with multiple levels of caches, where the cache close to processor is faster but smaller, and the cache far from processor is slower but larger. This leads to a fundamental property of modern processors: { the latency of accessing data in different cache levels and in main memory is different}. As a result, the timing of memory operations when fetching data from different cache levels, e.g., the timing of fetching data from closest-to-processor L1 cache vs. from main memory, can reveal secret-dependent information if attacker is able to observe the timing of these accesses and correlate them to the operation of the victim's code. Further, due to limited size of the caches, memory accesses by a victim may displace attacker's data from the cache, and with knowledge, or reverse-engineering, of the cache architecture, the attacker can learn some information about victim's data based on the modifications to the state of the cache -- which can be observed by the timing measurements. Caches are not only structures in the processor that can suffer from security vulnerabilities. As an essential mechanism to achieving high performance, cache-like structures are used pervasively in various processor components, such as the translation lookaside buffer (TLB) and processor frontend. Consequently, the vulnerabilities due to timing differences of accessing data in caches or cache-like structures affect many components of the processor. The main goal of this dissertation is the { design of high performance and secure computer architectures}. Since the sophisticated hardware components such as caches, TLBs, value predictors, and processor frontend are critical to ensure high performance, realizing this goal requires developing fundamental techniques to guarantee security in the presence of timing differences of different processor operations. Furthermore, effective defence mechanisms can be only developed after developing a formal and systematic understanding of all the possible attacks that timing side-channels can lead to. To realize the research goals, the main main contributions of this dissertation are: {itemize}[noitemsep]  Design and evaluation of a novel three-step cache timing model to understand theoretical vulnerabilities in caches  Development of a benchmark suite that can test if processor caches or secure cache designs are vulnerable to certain theoretical vulnerabilities.  Development of a timing vulnerability model to test TLBs and design of hardware defenses for the TLBs to address newly found vulnerabilities.  Analysis of value predictor attacks and design of defenses for value predictors.  Evaluation of vulnerabilities in processor frontends based on timing differences in the operation of the frontends.  Development of a design-time security verification framework for secure processor architectures, using information flow tracking methods. {itemize}  This dissertation combines the theoretical modeling and practical benchmarking analysis to help evaluate susceptibility of different architectures and microarchitectures to timing attacks on caches, TLBs, value predictors and processor frontend. Although cache timing side-channel attacks have been studied for more than a decade, there is no evidence that the previously-known attacks exhaustively cover all possible attacks. One of the initial research directions covered by this dissertation was to develop a model for cache timing attacks, which can help lead towards discovering all possible cache timing attacks. The proposed three-step cache timing vulnerability model provides a means to enumerate all possible interactions between the victim and attacker who are sharing a cache-like structure, producing the complete set of theoretical timing vulnerabilities. This dissertation also covers new theoretical cache timing attacks that are unknown prior to being found by the model. To make the advances in security not only theoretical, this dissertation also covers design of a benchmarking suite that runs on commodity processors and helps evaluate their cache's susceptibility to attacks, as well as can run on simulators to test potential or future cache designs. As the dissertation later demonstrates, the three-step timing vulnerability model can be naturally applied to any cache-like structures such as TLBs, and the dissertation encompasses a three-step model for TLBs, uncovering of theoretical new TLB attacks, and proposals for defenses. Building on success of analyzing caches and TLBs for new timing attacks, this dissertation then discusses follow-on research on evaluation and uncovering of new timing vulnerabilities in processor frontends. Since security analysis should be applied not just to existing processor microarchitectural features, the dissertation further analyzes possible future features such as value predictors. Although not currently in use, value predictors are actively being researched and proposed for addition into future microarchitectures. This dissertation shows, however, that they are vulnerable to attacks. Lastly, based on findings of the security issues with existing and proposed processor features, this dissertation explores how to better design secure processors from ground up, and presents a design-time security verification framework for secure processor architectures, using information flow tracking methods.","tags":[],"title":"Processor Microarchitecture Security","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shuwen Deng","Jakub Szefer"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1638662400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1638662400,"objectID":"781021c6109e8b3a221a32ad414e5fb2","permalink":"https://thu-has.github.io/publication/2021-new-predictor-based-attacks/","publishdate":"2023-09-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2021-new-predictor-based-attacks/","section":"publication","summary":"The microarchitectural state held by predictors in modern processors can leak sensitive information.

On the other hand, methodologies developed for interconnect circuits (mainly resistor-capacitor-inductor (RCL) networks) are not suitable for analog ICs. In this work, a topological reduction method is introduced that is able to automatically generate interpretable macromodel circuits in symbolic form; that is, the circuit elements in the compact model maintain analytical relations of the parameters of the original full circuit. This type of symbolic macromodel has several benefits that other traditional modeling methods do not offer: First, reusability, namely that designer need not repeatedly generate macromodels for the same circuit even it is re-sized or re-biased; second, interpretability, namely a designer may directly identify circuit parameters (in the original circuit) that are closely related to the dominant frequency characteristics, such as dc gain, gain/phase margins, and dominant poles/zeros.
